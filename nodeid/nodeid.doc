NodeID          Get network address and place into environment variables.

Description:    Sets four environment variables based on your machines
                configuration.  The four environment variables are as
                follows.

                VIDEO   This variable is set depending on the display adapter
                        installed in your computer.  It will be set to one
                        of the following.  Excuse any errors in translating the
                        acronyms.
                        MDA     Monochrome Display Adapter
                        CGA     Color Graphics Adapter
                        EGA     Enhanced Graphics Adapter
                        MCGA    Multi-Color Graphics Adapter
                        VGA     Video Graphics Adapter

                NETNUM  This variable is set to an 8 byte value for the
                        network number.  The network number is the number
                        assigned to the section of network your station is
                        connected.  You may have a number of computers on
                        the same network number.  In a single file server
                        installation with only one NIC (Network Interface
                        Card) then all the stations will have the same
                        network number.

                NODE1 & NODE2 compromise the 12 byte node address of the
                workstation.  The reason they are split up is so that it is
                easy to use the variables to create file names or
                subdirectories.

                NODE1   This variable is set to the first 4 bytes of the node
                        address of the workstation.  In a Arcnet installation
                        this will always be 0000 while in Ethernet and other
                        topologies this will vary by the card.  Usually cards
                        from the same manufacturer will have the same value
                        for all their cards.

                NODE2   This variable is set to the last 8 bytes of the node
                        address of the workstation.  This is the variable that
                        will probably be used the most to uniquely identify a
                        workstation.

Command Line Commands:  /Q      Quiet output.  This will not display any
                                messages unless an error occurs during the
                                program.

                        /N      Will not display a warning message if NETX is
                                not loaded.  Use this option with /Q if you
                                want no output and you are only loading IPX.

Requirements:   This program requires at a minimum that IPX be loaded.
                DOS 2.0+.

History of changes.
1.04
        3-Nov-93
        Converted to EXE instead of COM, no other changes.  Removed beta label.
        Has been out for a while and no bug reports.

1.03 beta
        4-Aug-93
        Removed windowing.  Added /Q & /N options.  Actually put a little
        documentation into the file.

1.02 beta
        Added a window look to display.

1.01 beta
        Added VIDEO environment variable.

1.00 beta
        Initial version of NodeID.  Written entirely in assembly language using
        the excellent Spontaneous Assembly library.  This version sets the
        NETNUM, NODE1, & NODE2 environment variables.  Also tests for DOS 2.0
        or above.
